## Day2

the challenge here was to model the game rules in a data structure. I have coerced the rules into a dictionary, something that works for three parts but would become unpractical with more parts.

the smart way to model the rules would probably have been some sort of ring structure that wraps around at the end (r < p < s < r) but I did not manage to achieve this in python.
